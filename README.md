# Introduction

Managing family expenses is often challenging when handled manually, leading to errors and poor financial tracking. This project, "Calculating Family Expenses using ServiceNow", demonstrates how ServiceNow can be extended beyond IT workflows to automate and simplify household financial management.

We designed a custom application that:

Tracks daily expenses for individual family members.

Consolidates them into family-level expenses automatically.

Uses business rules, auto-numbering, related lists, and relationships for smooth data flow.

Provides an accurate and user-friendly way to manage and analyze financial data.

By leveraging low-code/no-code features of ServiceNow, this project shows how the platform can be applied in real-life scenarios beyond IT service management.

# Features

 Custom tables: Family Expenses & Daily Expenses

 Auto-numbering for unique records

 Mandatory fields for accurate data

 Business rules to auto-update totals

 Relationships & related lists to connect records

 Easy-to-use forms for quick entry

# Outcome

This project provides a practical, scalable, and automated solution for managing family expenses. It also highlights how ServiceNow can be adapted for non-IT use cases, enhancing productivity and financial awareness in households.

# Conclusion

The project helped our team gain hands-on experience with:

ServiceNow tables, forms, fields, and configurations

Writing business rules and scripts

Building relationships and automation workflows

This application not only solves a real-life problem but also enhances our knowledge in ServiceNow development and low-code project building.
